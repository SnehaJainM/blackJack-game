# blackJack-game
### using HTML,CSS and JS.

Hello🖐 ,
I recently created  a simple BlackJack🎰 game using HTML , CSS, and Javascript.
Though this website isn't that responsive it works well on your mobile devices. As i have used a Mobile First Approach to create it.

## The rules of the game are straightforward:
- ♠️Players start with  2 random cards.
- ♠️They  can draw a new card if the sum of existing cards is less than 21.
- ♠️If the sum  exceeds 21, the player is out of the game !

  
 I invite you to checkout the game and have fun testing your luck! 🃏
